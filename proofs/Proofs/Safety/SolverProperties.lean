# Properties of a Tetris-solving program — the solver-characterization experiment

CONJECTURE (`TetrisSolvable`): there exists a `Solver` that survives forever against every legal
7-bag sequence. This file is a proof-experiment asking the *dual* of "is it solvable?": **if a
solving program exists, what must it be and do?** It assembles, as theorems, the necessary and
sufficient properties of any such program, on the safe-set / atlas framework (`Adversarial`,
`SafeSet`, `SafeIterateFinite`) and the difficulty results (`HeightControl`).

The very type `Solver cfg := GameState → Piece → Placement` already answers the first structural
question: the program sees only the CURRENT state and the CURRENT piece — it commits to a placement
with **no lookahead** of future pieces, yet must survive the worst-case sequence. Existence, the
invariant it maintains, the bound it holds, what it must *do* (clear), whether it can be a finite
table, and whether it must cycle, follow.

/-! ## Q1. When does a solving program exist? -/

/-- **A solving program exists iff `init ∈ safe`.** The existence of any valid solver is equivalent
to the single membership `GameState.init ∈ safe cfg` — the greatest fixed point of the one-step
safety operator. So the whole conjecture reduces to one (in-principle decidable) question, and the
*program* exists exactly when the *state* `init` lies in the maximal controlled-invariant set. -/

    (∃ σ : Solver cfg, SolvesTetrisValid cfg σ) ↔ GameState.init ∈ safe cfg :=
  (init_safe_iff_exists_solvesTetrisValid hcols).symm

/-! ## Q2. What region of the state space does a solving program stay in? -/

/-- **A solving program never leaves `safe`.** Every state on its trace, against every legal
sequence, lies in `safe cfg`. The program is a controller that renders `safe` invariant — it can
visit only states from which it can still survive. -/

    (hl : LegalSequence s) (n : ℕ) :
    adversarialTrace cfg σ s GameState.init n ∈ safe cfg :=
  solvesTetrisValid_trace_mem_safe h hl n

/-! ## Q3. What does a solving program GUARANTEE about the board? -/

/-- **A solving program holds `maxHeight ≤ rows` forever.** At every step, against every legal
sequence, a solver that never loses keeps the max column height within the ceiling (the survival
metric of `HeightControl`). So "solving" is operationally *"hold the single scalar `maxHeight ≤
rows` for all time"* — the program is a controller keeping one quantity under a bound against an
adversary, armed only with current-piece information and the line-clear primitive. -/

    (hl : LegalSequence s) (n : ℕ) :
